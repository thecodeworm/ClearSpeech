                    <p>We are a Science Fair group dedicated to improving people’s lives through technology, and this application is the result of that goal. Our team consists of three students—Aditya, Josh, and Advik—and we all attend Quail Valley Middle School.

The objective of this project was to design and develop an AI model capable of clarifying distorted or slurred speech. Such speech issues can arise from technical limitations, environmental interference, speech disorders, or other conditions that affect clarity and intelligibility. Our aim was to create a tool that can help make spoken communication more accessible and easier to understand.

Throughout this project, we invested significant time and effort into researching, coding, testing, and training the model ourselves. The development process involved overcoming numerous challenges, refining our approach, and continuously improving accuracy and performance. We are proud of the progress we have made and the results achieved.

This project represents months of dedication and collaboration, and we hope that this application proves useful to others. Thank you for taking the time to explore and use our work.</p>
